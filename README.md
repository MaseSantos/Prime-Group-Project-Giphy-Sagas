# Giphy Saga Group Project

### Built By:
Mase Santos, Eric Elvendahl, Nick Simonelli

## Description

>Duration, 24-hour Group Effort

This one day project was focused on utilizing Saga and api requests to create a more versatile and dynamic end product. The primary task of this project included providing the user with a search page where they would be able to browse for gifs. When desired one could favorite and image to which they would later be able to view and categorize.

With more time we would like to continue to add feedback visuals around buttons and inputs to provide the user with more natural response when interacting with our application. We would also like to provide users the option to name multiple categories per favorite image should they desire.
